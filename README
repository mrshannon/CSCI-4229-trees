This is an OpenGL tree scene written entirely in Haskell.  It was written as a
homework for CSCI 4229 computer graphics class.

Dependencies:

    + GHC (Haskell compiler)
    + Cabal >= 1.18 (Haskell build tool)
    + GLUT




Ubuntu 14.04 Specific Instructions:

    All non Haskell packages:

        apt-get install freeglut3-dev

    Because Ubuntu 14.04 LTS did not include the current 2014.2.0.0 Haskell
    Platform release.  The source code has been modified to work with the GHC
    version included with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS but Cabal >= 1.18 is required while
    14.04 LTS includes 1.16.  This leads to two solutions.

    Solution 1:

        Install the Haskell Platform from source or binary form from
        https://www.haskell.org/platform/linux.html


    Solution 2:

        Install the outdated Haskell platform:

            apt-get install haskell-platform

        Now prepend $HOME/.cabal/bin to your permanent PATH.

            export PATH=$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH

        NOTE: it is safe to do this in your shell configuration.

        Now as like most problems in Haskell we solve it recursively by running
        (not as root):

            cabal update
            cabal install cabal-install




Building:

    NOTE: Due to GLUtil (used for loading the textures) the build dependency
    list is much longer.  This means the build will take 3-5 minutes.  If you
    wish to avoid this build time a pre-compiled 64bit binary for Linux is
    included.

    This program can be built with the given `Makefile`.

    Using make will automatically create a Cabal sandbox and install all needed
    Haskell dependencies.  The default make rule will build a statically linked
    `planetoid` binary in the top level directory.  The optional make rules are
    listed below.

    Build program statically:

        make static

    Build program dynamically:

        make dynamic

    NOTE: If you make a dynamic executable it will need the sandbox to remain in
    the same location for it to run.  However, it will reduce the size of the
    executable by up up 1-2 orders of magnitude.

    Clean up temporary build files:

        make clean-tmp

    Clean up build files and executable (does not remove sandbox):

        make clean

    Clean up everything, including the sandbox:

        make clean-all

    NOTE: Do not be alarmed at large CPU usage as the Makefile is setup to install
    the dependencies in parallel.




Features:

    Forest:
        This program draws a forest with 2000 trees so a good system is
        required.  It will run on Intel HD 4000 graphics cards and above but
        will not perform well without a dedicated GPU.

    Mipmapping:
        This program uses mipmapping but only on OpenGL version 3.0 and higher.

    Day/Night Cycle:
        This program has a day night cycle with long days and short nights.

    Skybox:
        This program uses a skybox but only of limited size as I could not find
        a higher resolution one for free.




Usage:

    arrow keys = rotate the camera

    wsad = move camera

    shift/space = lower/raise camera

    c = change camera type (perspective/orthogonal)

    v = change shading type (flat/smooth/wire)

    p = pause/resume the animation

    [ or ] = step back/forward animation




Time Took: 

    1.5 days.
